# Environmental Data Chatbot Backend

## Overview
This project is a backend for an advanced environmental data chatbot built with Rasa. It integrates multiple data sources and technologies to provide users with:
- **Incident reporting** (Neo4j)
- **Water quality queries** (GraphDB/SPARQL)
- **Policy queries** (GraphDB/SPARQL)
- **Air quality queries** (AQICN API)
- **Feedback collection** (Neo4j)
- **Response analysis and improvement** (Gemini API)

```

## File-by-File Explanation

### 1. `actions/air_quality.py`
- Handles air quality queries using AQICN API.
- Geocodes city/location using geopy/Nominatim.
- Fetches AQI and pollutant data, formats response with emojis.
- Handles errors and fallback to city name search.

### 2. `actions/actions.py`
- Implements incident reporting form (slot filling, validation).
- Saves incident reports to Neo4j with unique IDs.
- Handles form activation, deactivation, and exit.
- Validates user input for each slot (name, contact, etc.).

### 3. `actions/feedback.py`
- Stores user feedback (thumbs up/down) in Neo4j.
- Handles feedback description for negative feedback.
- Stores last user query and bot response for context.

### 4. `actions/graphdb_client.py`
- Handles water quality and policy queries using SPARQLWrapper.
- Extracts city/municipality from user message.
- Builds and executes SPARQL queries for:
  - Water quality (by city, river, station)
  - Policy data (Spanish cities)
- Formats results for chatbot display.

### 5. `actions/response_analyzer.py`
- Uses Gemini API to analyze and improve bot responses.
- Checks grammar, structure, accuracy, formatting, completeness.
- Adds emojis and bullet points for readability.
- Detects city context from station IDs via GraphDB.

## Data Flow

```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant R as Rasa
    participant A as Actions
    participant N as Neo4j
    participant G as GraphDB
    participant Q as AQICN
    participant GR as Gemini

    U->>R: User query
    R->>A: Custom action call
    A->>N: Save incident/feedback (if reporting/feedback)
    A->>G: SPARQL query (if water/policy)
    A->>Q: API call (if air quality)
    A->>GR: Analyze/improve response
    A->>R: Return formatted response
    R->>U: Bot reply
```

## Key Technologies
- **Rasa**: Conversational AI framework
- **Neo4j**: Graph database for incident/feedback storage
- **GraphDB**: RDF triple store for water/policy data (SPARQL queries)
- **SPARQLWrapper**: Python library for SPARQL queries
- **AQICN API**: Real-time air quality data
- **geopy**: Geocoding for location/city extraction
- **Gemini API**: LLM-based response improvement

## How Each Component Works

### Incident Reporting (Neo4j)
- User fills a form (slots: incident_type, user_name, contact_number, etc.)
- Data validated and saved to Neo4j as a node with timestamp and unique ID.
- User receives confirmation and summary.

### Water Quality Queries (GraphDB/SPARQL)
- User asks for water data ("Show water quality for Madrid")
- City/municipality extracted from message.
- SPARQL query built and sent to GraphDB.
- Results formatted (physical/chemical/other parameters, years, locations).

### Policy Queries (GraphDB/SPARQL)
- User asks for policies ("Policy for Madrid")
- City extracted and checked against supported list.
- SPARQL query built for comprehensive or waste-focused policies.
- Results formatted (regulations, waste schedules, emission standards, etc.).

### Air Quality Queries (AQICN API)
- User asks for air quality ("AQI in Paris")
- City/location geocoded to lat/lon.
- AQICN API called for AQI and pollutants.
- Results formatted with emojis and levels.

### Feedback Collection (Neo4j)
- User gives thumbs up/down.
- Feedback saved to Neo4j with context (query, response, description).

### Response Analysis (Gemini API)
- After each bot response, Gemini API analyzes and improves reply.
- Checks grammar, formatting, completeness, adds emojis.
- Enhanced response sent to user if significantly improved.

## Configuration Files
- `config.yml`: Rasa pipeline and policies (Spacy, DIET, Fallback, etc.)
- `domain.yml`: Intents, entities, slots, forms, responses, actions
- `endpoints.yml`: Action server, GraphDB endpoints, Neo4j credentials
- `credentials.yml`: Rasa REST and other channel credentials
- `data/nlu.yml`: Training data for intents/entities

- `data/stories.yml`: Example stories for feedback and queries

---

## Environment Variables
- Set Neo4j credentials in `endpoints.yml` or as environment variables:
  - `NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687`
  - `NEO4J_USER=neo4j`
  - `NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password`
- GraphDB endpoints:
  - `WATERBASE_SPARQL=http://localhost:7200/repositories/waterbase`
